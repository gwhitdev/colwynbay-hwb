# **Colwyn Bay Hwb**
## **Site Overview**
The Colwyn Bay Community Hwb and Foodbank is a new community space open 7 days a week, 52 days a year. It is a project in its early stages but has already made progress in developing services and opportunities for local people. However, as with most new ventures, publicity can be difficult to achieve - especially with limited charitable resources available. This website serves as a source of key information for current and new users of the Hwb. It is intended to be a well designed and easy to use lightweight publicity platform and portal.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
- People who want to discover general information about the Hwb.
- People who want to find out how to donate to the organisation.
- People who want to make use of the Hwb's foodbank.
- People who need to hire a room.
- People who want to find out what events are coming up or which groups are in regular attendance at the Hwb.

### **User Stories:**
- As a general user of the Hwb's website, I want the website to be well designed and easy to navigate, so that I can find the information that I want quickly.
- As someone who hasn't visited the Hwb before, I want to feel that I know more about the Hwb after leaving the website than I did before visiting, so that I can visit the Hwb in person and know when it is open.
- As someone who needs to use the foodbank, I need to know where it is and its opening times, so that I can access it.
- As an event organiser, I want to know basic information about room hire, so that I can make a decision about making a booking.
- As a general user of the Hwb's website, I want to be able to easily contact the Hwb from the website, so that I can enquire about the Hwb's variety of services.
- As an event attendee, I want to learn about upcoming events, so that I can decide if I want to attend.
- As a potential donor, I want to be able to learn how the Hwb accepts donations, so that I can decide how to donate.
  
### **Site Aims:**
- To inform people about the Hwb's aims and purpose.
- To inform people about the Hwb's services and how they can visit.
- To provide details about donating.
- To provide a method of communication with the Hwb.
- To provide event and group organisers with a means of publicising their events and groups.
